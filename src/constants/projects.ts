      "Punky.AI is an AI-powered Discord bot designed to automate community moderation, support, and engagement. As a full-stack developer, I built both the backend REST API and the frontend dashboard from scratch. The backend is powered by TypeScript and Express.js, with a clean and scalable REST API architecture connected to MongoDB. I integrated OpenAI's APIs to deliver intelligent moderation and ticketing systems. On the frontend, I developed a fast and intuitive admin panel using React, Vite, and TailwindCSS. Every aspect of the project‚Äîfrom API routing and database design to the UX flow‚Äîwas crafted with performance, reliability, and real user needs in mind. Punky.AI is not just a bot; it‚Äôs a robust platform engineered to scale with modern Discord communities.",
