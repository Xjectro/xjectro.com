## Automatic Deployment with SSH Keys: Building a Simple CI System

Manual deployment is time-consuming, error-prone, and doesn't scale well as your projects grow. Setting up automatic deployment with SSH keys can transform your development workflow, enabling seamless CI/CD pipelines that deploy your code safely and efficiently.

## What is Automatic Deployment?

Automatic deployment is the process of automatically releasing your code changes to production or staging environments without manual intervention. When combined with SSH (Secure Shell) keys for authentication, it provides a secure and reliable way to deploy applications.

## Why SSH Keys for Deployment?

- **Security:** SSH keys provide stronger authentication than passwords
- **Automation-Friendly:** No interactive password prompts needed
- **Granular Access Control:** Different keys can have different permissions
- **Audit Trail:** Easy to track which key was used for deployments
- **Revocable:** Keys can be easily disabled if compromised

## Setting Up SSH Keys for Deployment

### 1. Generate SSH Key Pair

First, generate a dedicated SSH key pair for deployment:

```bash
# Generate a new SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "deployment@yourproject.com" -f ~/.ssh/deploy_key

# Or use RSA if ed25519 isn't supported
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "deployment@yourproject.com" -f ~/.ssh/deploy_key
```

### 2. Configure the Server

Copy the public key to your server:

```bash
# Copy public key to server
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/deploy_key.pub user@your-server.com

# Or manually add it to authorized_keys
cat ~/.ssh/deploy_key.pub | ssh user@your-server.com "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

### 3. Test the Connection

Verify SSH key authentication works:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/deploy_key user@your-server.com
```

## Building a Simple CI System

### Basic Deployment Script

Create a deployment script that your CI system can execute:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy.sh

set -e  # Exit on any error

# Configuration
REPO_URL="git@github.com:username/project.git"
DEPLOY_PATH="/var/www/your-app"
BRANCH="main"
SERVER_USER="deploy"
SERVER_HOST="your-server.com"

echo "üöÄ Starting deployment..."

# Connect to server and deploy
ssh -i ~/.ssh/deploy_key $SERVER_USER@$SERVER_HOST << 'EOF'
    cd /var/www/your-app
    echo "üì¶ Pulling latest changes..."
    git pull origin main
    
    echo "üìã Installing dependencies..."
    npm install --production
    
    echo "üî® Building application..."
    npm run build
    
    echo "üîÑ Restarting services..."
    sudo systemctl restart your-app
    
    echo "‚úÖ Deployment completed successfully!"
EOF

echo "üéâ Deployment finished!"
```

### GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
    
    - name: Run linting
      run: npm run lint

  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup SSH
      uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.7.0
      with:
        ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_SSH_KEY }}
    
    - name: Deploy to server
      run: |
        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_USER }}@${{ secrets.DEPLOY_HOST }} << 'EOF'
          cd ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PATH }}
          git pull origin main
          npm install --production
          npm run build
          sudo systemctl restart your-app
        EOF
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Use Dedicated Deployment User

Create a specific user for deployments with limited permissions:

```bash
# Create deploy user
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash deploy

# Add to necessary groups
sudo usermod -aG www-data deploy

# Set up sudo permissions for specific services only
echo "deploy ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl restart your-app" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/deploy
```

### 2. Restrict SSH Access

Configure SSH for the deployment key in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`:

```bash
# Restrict the key to specific commands and IP ranges
command="cd /var/www/your-app && git pull && npm install --production && npm run build",from="192.168.1.0/24,10.0.0.0/8" ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5... deployment@yourproject.com
```

### 3. Environment Variables and Secrets

Never commit sensitive data. Use environment variables:

```bash
# .env.production (never commit this)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db
API_SECRET=your-secret-key
JWT_SECRET=another-secret
```

### 4. Monitor and Log Deployments

Add logging to your deployment script:

```bash
# Add to deploy script
LOG_FILE="/var/log/deployments.log"
echo "$(date): Deployment started by $(whoami)" >> $LOG_FILE

# Log deployment results
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "$(date): Deployment successful" >> $LOG_FILE
else
    echo "$(date): Deployment failed" >> $LOG_FILE
fi
```

## Advanced CI/CD Features

### Rolling Deployments

Implement zero-downtime deployments:

```bash
# Blue-green deployment script
CURRENT_VERSION=$(readlink /var/www/current)
NEW_VERSION="/var/www/releases/$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)"

# Deploy to new version
mkdir -p $NEW_VERSION
git clone $REPO_URL $NEW_VERSION
cd $NEW_VERSION && npm install && npm run build

# Switch traffic to new version
ln -sfn $NEW_VERSION /var/www/current
sudo systemctl reload nginx

# Keep last 3 releases
ls -1dt /var/www/releases/* | tail -n +4 | xargs rm -rf
```

### Health Checks

Add automatic health checks after deployment:

```bash
# Health check function
check_health() {
    local url="https://your-app.com/health"
    local max_attempts=30
    local attempt=1
    
    while [ $attempt -le $max_attempts ]; do
        if curl -s $url | grep -q "OK"; then
            echo "‚úÖ Health check passed"
            return 0
        fi
        echo "‚è≥ Attempt $attempt/$max_attempts failed, retrying..."
        sleep 10
        ((attempt++))
    done
    
    echo "‚ùå Health check failed after $max_attempts attempts"
    return 1
}

# Use in deployment script
if check_health; then
    echo "üéâ Deployment successful!"
else
    echo "üí• Rolling back deployment..."
    # Rollback logic here
fi
```

## Common Deployment Patterns

<Table data={{
  headers: [
    'Pattern',
    'Use Case',
    'Complexity',
    'Downtime'
  ],
  rows: [
    ['Simple Script', 'Small projects', 'Low', 'Yes'],
    ['Blue-Green', 'Zero downtime needed', 'Medium', 'No'],
    ['Rolling Update', 'Gradual rollout', 'High', 'Minimal'],
    ['Canary Release', 'Risk mitigation', 'High', 'No'],
  ]
}} />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### SSH Permission Denied
```bash
# Check SSH key permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/deploy_key
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/deploy_key.pub

# Verify SSH agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/deploy_key
ssh-add -l
```

### Deployment Script Fails
```bash
# Add debugging to scripts
set -x  # Print commands as they execute
set -e  # Exit on first error

# Test components individually
ssh -i ~/.ssh/deploy_key user@server "echo 'Connection works'"
```

### File Permission Issues
```bash
# Fix ownership after deployment
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/your-app
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/your-app
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

Set up deployment notifications:

```bash
# Slack notification function
send_slack_notification() {
    local message="$1"
    local status="$2"
    local color="good"
    
    if [ "$status" != "success" ]; then
        color="danger"
    fi
    
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
        --data "{\"attachments\":[{\"color\":\"$color\",\"text\":\"$message\"}]}" \
        $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
}

# Use in deployment script
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    send_slack_notification "‚úÖ Deployment to production successful" "success"
else
    send_slack_notification "‚ùå Deployment to production failed" "error"
fi
```

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Use dedicated SSH keys** for deployment, separate from personal keys
2. **Implement proper access controls** with limited user permissions
3. **Always test deployments** in staging before production
4. **Monitor deployment health** with automated checks
5. **Keep deployment logs** for troubleshooting and auditing
6. **Have a rollback plan** ready for when things go wrong
7. **Use environment-specific configurations** and secrets management
8. **Automate everything** but keep manual override capabilities

## Conclusion

Setting up automatic deployment with SSH keys creates a robust foundation for your CI/CD pipeline. While the initial setup requires careful attention to security and configuration, the long-term benefits of reliable, automated deployments far outweigh the investment.

Start simple with basic scripts, then gradually add more sophisticated features like health checks, rollback mechanisms, and monitoring. Remember that the goal is to make deployments so reliable and routine that they become invisible to your development process.

With proper SSH key management and deployment automation, you'll spend less time on manual deployment tasks and more time building features that matter to your users.
