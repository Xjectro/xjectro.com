## What is Payload CMS?

Payload CMS is a modern, open-source headless Content Management System (CMS) built with Node.js and TypeScript. Unlike traditional CMS platforms, Payload is API-first, developer-friendly, and highly customizable—making it an excellent choice for building scalable web applications, blogs, e-commerce sites, and more.

### Key Features

- **Headless Architecture:** Manage content separately from your frontend, enabling flexibility across web, mobile, and other platforms.
- **TypeScript Support:** Enjoy type safety and modern development workflows.
- **Customizable Admin Panel:** Easily tailor the admin UI to your needs.
- **Authentication & Access Control:** Built-in user management and granular permissions.
- **Local File Storage & Cloud Integrations:** Store media locally or connect to cloud providers.
- **REST & GraphQL APIs:** Access your content via flexible APIs out of the box.
- **Extensible Plugins:** Add custom functionality with a growing ecosystem of plugins.

## Why Choose Payload CMS?

Payload stands out for its developer experience, extensibility, and performance. You get full control over your data models, REST/GraphQL APIs, and the ability to write custom business logic. Its modern stack and open-source nature make it a future-proof choice for both startups and enterprises.

## Use Cases

- Content-rich websites and blogs
- E-commerce platforms
- SaaS dashboards
- Mobile app backends
- Custom admin panels

## Setting Up Your First Payload CMS Project in 10 Minutes

Follow these simple steps to get started:

### 1. Install Node.js

Payload requires Node.js (v18+). Download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### 2. Create a New Project

A new Payload project can be created using the command line:

```bash
npx create-payload-app
```

Follow the prompts to choose a template and set up your project folder.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd your-project-name
npm install
```

### 4. Configure Your Environment

Copy the example environment file and update it as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set your MongoDB connection string and other environment variables.

### 5. Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start Payload locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Payload’s admin panel will be available at [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin).

### 6. Define Your Collections

Collections are like content types (e.g., Posts, Users). You can define them in the `payload.config.ts` file.

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config';
import Posts from './collections/Posts';

export default buildConfig({
  collections: [Posts],
});
```

### 7. Start Creating Content

Log in to the admin panel, add your first documents, and explore the API endpoints.
